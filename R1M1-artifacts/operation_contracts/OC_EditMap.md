# Operation Contract: Edit Map

## Operation: editMap(mapId: String): void

## Cross References: Use Case UC2 - Edit Map

## Preconditions:
- The application is running
- The Player has selected "Edit Map" from the main menu
- If mapId is provided, the map with that ID exists in the system

## Postconditions:
- If mapId is provided, the specified map is loaded into the editor
- If mapId is not provided, a new blank map is created with default dimensions
- The map editor interface is displayed with:
  - Grid representation of the map
  - Tools panel with terrain types, path elements, and decorative objects
  - Properties panel for selected elements
  - File operations (save, load)
- The system maintains an undo/redo history of map modifications
- Map validation status is continuously updated (checking for valid paths, start/end points)
- Map data is maintained in memory until explicitly saved

## Notes:
- Editing an existing map should not modify the stored version until saved
- Map editor should enforce game rules (e.g., continuous paths from entry to exit)
- The editor should provide visual feedback for invalid configurations
- Auto-save functionality should create recovery points periodically
- Complex terrain features may require multiple tool operations to create
- Property panel contents change contextually based on selected map elements
