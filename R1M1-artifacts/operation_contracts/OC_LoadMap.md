# Operation Contract: Load Map

## Operation: loadMap(mapName: String): Map

## Cross References: Use Case UC7 - Load Map

## Preconditions:
- The application is running
- The player has selected "New Game" from the main menu
- A map with the specified mapName exists in storage

## Postconditions:
- The Map file is retrieved from persistent storage
- The Map data is deserialized into a Map object
- The Map object's integrity is verified:
  - Start and end points are present and valid
  - Path is fully connected
  - Tower slots are properly defined
- The Map object is prepared for rendering in the game
- The operation returns the loaded Map object, or null if loading failed

## Notes:
- The returned Map object does not start the game automatically
- Map loading errors should be handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
- Map integrity validation should be thorough to prevent gameplay issues
- Loading corrupted maps should provide options to delete or repair them
- This operation only loads the map structure, not the game state
