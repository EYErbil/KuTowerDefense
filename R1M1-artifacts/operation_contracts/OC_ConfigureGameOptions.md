## Operation: saveGameOptions(options: GameOptions): Boolean

## Cross References: Use Case UC13 - Configure Game Options

## Preconditions:
- The application is running
- The Player has accessed the options screen
- The Player has modified one or more game settings

## Postconditions:
- The GameOptions object is updated with all player-configured settings:
  - Enemy parameters (waves, groups, enemies, delays, composition)
  - Economy parameters (starting gold, gold earned from defeating enemies)
  - Combat parameters (player hit points, enemy hit points, tower damage)
  - Tower parameters (costs, range, rate of fire, AOE radius)
  - Movement parameters (enemy speeds)
- The updated GameOptions is persisted to storage
- The settings will be applied to all future game sessions
- The operation returns true if options were successfully saved, false otherwise

## Notes:
- GameOptions uses Java's Serializable interface for persistent storage
- Options persistence should allow settings to be maintained across application restarts
- Default settings should be available if the Player chooses to reset
