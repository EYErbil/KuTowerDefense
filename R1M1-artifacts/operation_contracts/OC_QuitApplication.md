# Operation Contract: Quit Game

## Operation: quitGame(): void

## Cross References: Use Case UC4 - Quit Game

## Preconditions:
- The application is running
- The Player has initiated an exit action (clicked "Quit Game" or window close button)

## Postconditions:
- All unsaved data is handled appropriately:
  - Unsaved maps in editor prompt for save action
  - Active game sessions issue confirmation for progress loss
- All system resources are properly released:
  - Open files are closed
  - Timers and threads are terminated
  - Memory is freed
- The application terminates cleanly with exit code 0

## Notes:
- Different quit scenarios need different handling:
  - Quitting from main menu requires minimal cleanup
  - Quitting from an active game requires session termination
  - Quitting from map editor with unsaved changes requires save prompt
- The application should intercept operating system window close events
- All configuration settings should be persisted before exit
