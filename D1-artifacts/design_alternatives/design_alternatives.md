# Design Alternatives Analysis

In the development of the KU Tower Defense game, several design alternatives were considered for key aspects of the system. This document explores three significant design decisions, their alternatives, and the associated trade-offs.

## 1. Enemy Path Implementation

### Alternative 1: Fixed Path Using Waypoints
**Description**: Implement enemy movement using a predefined sequence of waypoints that enemies follow.

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Predictable enemy behavior
- Low computational overhead
- Easy to visualize in the map editor
- Consistent with classic tower defense mechanics

**Cons**:
- Limited flexibility for complex path patterns
- Difficult to modify path during gameplay
- Cannot support dynamic pathing based on tower placement
- Less realistic movement behaviors

### Alternative 2: Grid-Based Pathfinding (A* Algorithm)
**Description**: Use A* pathfinding algorithm where enemies recalculate optimal paths in real-time.

**Pros**:
- Supports dynamic path recalculation when obstacles (towers) are placed
- More realistic enemy behavior
- Can adapt to changing game conditions
- Allows for more complex gameplay strategies

**Cons**:
- Significantly higher computational cost
- More complex to implement and debug
- May lead to unpredictable enemy behavior
- Requires additional collision detection systems
- Could conflict with the core tower defense mechanic of path manipulation

### Alternative 3: Flow Field Pathfinding
**Description**: Create a vector field across the map grid that guides enemy movement.

**Pros**:
- Efficient for large numbers of enemies following similar paths
- Can handle dynamic obstacles
- Smooth movement transitions
- Good performance scaling with many units

**Cons**:
- Complex to implement correctly
- Difficult to visualize and debug
- May not align well with grid-based map design
- Overkill for the standard tower defense requirements

### Selected Approach
We chose **Alternative 1: Fixed Path Using Waypoints** because:
- It aligns with the traditional tower defense gameplay
- It's consistent with the requirements of having a single connected path from start to exit
- It simplifies the map editor implementation
- It offers sufficient functionality without unnecessary complexity
- It provides predictable performance even with many enemies

## 2. Tower Targeting Strategies

### Alternative 1: Inheritance-Based Strategy
**Description**: Implement targeting behavior through class inheritance, where each tower type extends a base Tower class with its own targeting method.

**Pros**:
- Direct mapping between tower types and behaviors
- Easier to understand the relationship between tower types
- Simpler implementation for a limited number of tower types
- Consistent with object-oriented design principles

**Cons**:
- Limited flexibility for changing targeting strategies
- Difficult to add new targeting behaviors without modifying class hierarchy
- Potential code duplication across similar targeting behaviors
- Tightly couples tower types with targeting behavior

### Alternative 2: Strategy Pattern
**Description**: Separate targeting behavior into strategy classes that can be assigned to towers independently of tower type.

**Pros**:
- Decouples targeting behavior from tower implementation
- Allows towers to change targeting strategy dynamically
- Enables sharing strategies across different tower types
- Facilitates adding new strategies without modifying existing code
- Supports player-selected targeting modes

**Cons**:
- Increases overall system complexity
- More indirection in the code
- May be excessive for the current requirements
- Slightly higher runtime overhead due to delegation

### Alternative 3: Component-Based System
**Description**: Implement towers and behaviors as components that can be combined in different ways.

**Pros**:
- Highly flexible and extensible
- Supports complex combinations of behaviors
- Enables reusable components across game entities
- Facilitates tower upgrading with component replacement

**Cons**:
- Significant architectural complexity
- Steeper learning curve for development team
- Potentially difficult to reason about system behavior
- Might be overengineered for current requirements

### Selected Approach
We chose **Alternative 2: Strategy Pattern** because:
- It balances flexibility with implementation complexity
- It allows for future expansion of targeting strategies
- It supports the potential feature of player-selectable targeting modes
- It follows good software engineering principles
- It facilitates more straightforward testing of targeting algorithms

## 3. Game State Management

### Alternative 1: Centralized Game State
**Description**: Maintain all game state in a single GameSession class that coordinates all game entities.

**Pros**:
- Clear ownership of game state
- Simplified state transitions
- Easier to implement save/load functionality
- Centralized control over game flow
- Simpler dependency management

**Cons**:
- Can become a "god object" with too many responsibilities
- May lead to tight coupling with other components
- Potential performance bottlenecks with many entities
- Harder to test in isolation

### Alternative 2: State Pattern
**Description**: Use the State pattern to represent different game states (Menu, Playing, Paused, GameOver) with state-specific behavior encapsulation.

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of different game states
- Encapsulated state-specific behavior
- Clean transition logic between states
- Easier to add new states
- Prevents conditional logic sprawl

**Cons**:
- Introduces additional classes and complexity
- Potential for shared state management issues
- Can be overly formal for simple state transitions
- May complicate persistence mechanisms

### Alternative 3: Event-Driven Architecture
**Description**: Implement game state changes through events and observers, where components respond to state change events.

**Pros**:
- Loose coupling between components
- Facilitates parallel development
- More flexible for extending functionality
- Natural fit for UI updates
- Supports complex interaction patterns

**Cons**:
- Can be difficult to debug and reason about
- Potential for event storms under high load
- May introduce timing and race condition issues
- Higher complexity for simple interactions

### Selected Approach
We chose a hybrid approach combining **Alternative 1** and **Alternative 2** because:
- The centralized GameSession provides clear ownership of core game state
- The State pattern handles the application-level states cleanly
- This combination balances simplicity with proper separation of concerns
- It provides clear transitions between major game states
- It maintains good performance characteristics
- It's easier for the team to understand and implement

## Conclusion

These design decisions were made with careful consideration of the requirements, performance implications, and development constraints. The selected approaches prioritize:

1. Clarity and maintainability of the codebase
2. Appropriate flexibility for future extensions
3. Performance characteristics suitable for the game genre
4. Alignment with standard software engineering practices
5. Balance between architectural purity and practical implementation needs

As development progresses, these decisions will be revisited and refined based on emerging requirements and practical considerations identified during implementation.
